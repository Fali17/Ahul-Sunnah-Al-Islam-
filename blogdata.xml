They were promised a return to this paradise if they carried out his orders, and killing themselves for him was his way of telling them that they would go to this paradise forever.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;They were taught to obey unquestioningly and to believe that death was but a small price to pay for the eternal reward.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They often used to kill themselves if they ever got into trouble or got caught.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Their belief was such that they were willing to sacrifice their lives with joy for their religion, without hesitation or fear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(The Damascus Chronicle of the Crusades.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ibn al-Athir:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;They were masters of deception, mingling with their targets and awaiting the moment when vigilance was least, striking fearlessly even if death was certain.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bernard Lewis:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The Assassins (Hashashin) were the first group in recorded history to use assassination as a systematic and organized tool of policy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Their influence or impact on the Islamic world was quite horrible, as they were causing chaos. Even Hulegu Khan said after conquering Alamut that they had ended the wolves of the mountains, who did nothing but create chaos in the land.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They mostly supported the Crusaders and were always against the Sunni rulers and Sunni Islam. They really hated Sunnis and often killed Sunnis, and they also killed Nazim-ul-Mulk, a minister of the Seljuks. There is even a letter from the founder of the Hashashin to that minister:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;I am surrounded by mountains, and with God’s help, I am in no need of your protection. Be content with your empire and leave me to govern my stronghold.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(I have read this in many Persian chronicles.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Al-Juwayni:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The Assassins (Hashashin) were like the shadow of fear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rashid al-Din:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The Hashashin knew they could not face armies in open battle, so they devised another way to fight. By killing the commanders, the generals, and the viziers, they disrupted the entire machinery of war. A single blade from them was more effective than a thousand swords on the battlefield.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Jami&#39; al-Tawarikh)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ibn al-Athir:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;These people were like no other. They would enter the courts of kings and governors, dressed as ordinary people, and wait for months, sometimes years, to accomplish their mission. They struck when least expected, even in the most heavily guarded places. This created a fear so widespread that no ruler felt secure on his throne. Even Nizam al-Mulk fell victim to their daggers, causing disarray in the administration of the empire.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Al-Juwayni:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Their leaders claimed to follow a hidden Imam and justified their killings as divine justice. They would say, &#39;It is not for men to question the will of the Imam.&#39; But to the rest of Islam, they were an abomination, striking fear and mistrust wherever they went.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ibn al-Athir:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;While the Franks (Crusaders) advanced, spreading destruction among the lands of Islam, the Assassins struck not at the invaders but at the leaders of the Muslims. Their blades found the throats of viziers, emirs, and generals who had risen to defend the faith. Such actions served only the enemies of Islam.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;William of Tyre:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The Assassins, though Muslims themselves, did not hesitate to strike deals with the Christian lords. Their enmity toward the Seljuks was greater than their devotion to their faith, and they sought allies wherever they could find them, even among the enemies of Islam.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(History of Deeds)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They were basically the enemies of Islam in a way; they even killed those who wanted to unite the Muslims. They did nothing good for us, and the rulers, even after the Mongol invasion of Alamut, still feared that they were not completely safe, as these guys made them fear, as they would even get inside castles anywhere just to kill someone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And this game, Assassins Creed, is also based upon them, and because of their actions, they made a game about these guys.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/8172735842119946460/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/8172735842119946460?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/8172735842119946460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/8172735842119946460'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/11/hashashin-assassins-from-ismaili-sect.html' title='Hashashin (The Assassins from the Ismaili Sect or The guys on whom the Assassins Creed game is based on)'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-7374863041906618166</id><published>2024-11-28T06:10:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2024-11-28T06:10:26.115-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Difference between Akbar and Sultan Aurangzeb</title><content type='html'>&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vincent Smith in Akbar the Great Mogul: “Din-i-Ilahi never succeeded in winning mass acceptance, nor was it a religion in the traditional sense, it was never a religiion thats a misconception.

His command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent, and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Words here are mentioned &#39;the likes of the earth and the heavens meaning different realms or dimensions within the Earth&#39;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We know that the previous tafsirs of this Ayah were limited to the knowledge of people as they didn&#39;t had access to current level of science and through modern science we can look for some possible meanings of this verse like is this about the multi-verse?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example: String Theory:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;String theory is the idea that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings of energy. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, and their vibrations determine the properties of particles, like mass and charge. Essentially, the universe is like a cosmic symphony played on these strings. And its like that this world has some key points and dimensions which we don&#39;t know about but if we found them then other dimensions can be visible to us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;In string theory, the universe may have more than the four familiar dimensions—up to ten or eleven dimensions of space and time, the extra dimensions could be compactified and not perceptible to our senses.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Brian Greene, [The Elegant Universe.]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Multiverse Theory (The Multi-Verse):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The multiverse is the idea that our universe is just one of countless others, each with its own laws of physics, constants, and realities. In the &#39;many-worlds&#39; interpretation, every time a quantum event occurs, the universe splits into parallel branches, creating alternate versions of reality where every possible outcome happens or the way its shown in the movies like in dragon ball the time travel od tunks to warn others about the androids and goku not dying because he got the medicine of heart disease, so, this reality changed by him staying alive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;In the many-worlds interpretation, all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some &#39;world&#39; or universe, leading to an ever-expanding multiverse.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Hugh Everett III (1957), this person is actually the guy who is called the originator of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (The Multi-Verse).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Observable Universe:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The observable universe is but a small fraction of the entire cosmos. Theoretical models suggest that there may be regions of space-time beyond our observable reach, possibly containing different physical constants or even different types of universes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Max Tegmark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, this also means that there might be something like the aliens who are out there or there is some other realm or maybe the black hole leads to another dimension, but the cameras stop working near the hole so we gotta throw someone in with some way to get him back to confirm this. And if there are aliens then we should find them and make them our slaves before they ever try to invade the earth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This all might sound a bit crazy or you might think is this guy using a chair which is not balanced so maybe that&#39;s why he is saying such stuff but it&#39;s that when you are deep in science you do start to talk this way at times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And it is possible that the like of them means that they might be similar planets to the Earth and different creatures might be living upon them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And to end this i wanna share this aswell:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr. Maurice Bucaile said in his book the Science, Bible and The Quran:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;There are contradictions in the gospels about the ascension of Jesus and only two of them mention his ascension and the death of Jesus in these books are mentioned with a different way in each with too many contradictions as one passage said 40 women went to the tomb of Jesus but, in the other book only a single woman  visited the tomb And The Gospels are like the Ahadith of the Muslims as they are narrated by people and are not written by eyewitnesses.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;When i started to study the Quran with an open mind i was shocked to see how anyone can say that a man who was illiterate has written this book  ? and when i came across that it mentions what Modern Science is confirming today made me realize and had my belief on this book that it is not written by any man its completely divine as it described things which no human from the 6th century could and even the scientists here in France nor the romans or the Persians ever had any of the discoveries which are already mentioned 1300 years ago in the Quran.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/386902760045222194/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/386902760045222194?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/386902760045222194'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/386902760045222194'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-miraculous-verses-of-holy-quran-for.html' title='The Miraculous Verses of the Holy Quran, for which even contemporary (Modern) science cannot offer an explanation for.'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-656285043603851260</id><published>2024-11-22T14:54:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2024-11-22T14:55:02.020-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Saying of Imam Shafi (rh)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&quot;Every good thing for the Muslim is through the sake of Rasool Allah (SAW) and whatever bad does not befall us is also by his (SAW) grace.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Al Risala pg 17)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;قال امام الشافعي:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;كل خير للمسلم هو بفضل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكل شر لا يصيبنا فهو أيضًا ببركته عليه الصلاة والسلام.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

When this verse was revealed, the Messenger - peace be upon him - invited the delegation of Najran to mubahala. The Messenger of God - peace be upon him - came out carrying Al-Hussein, holding the hand of Al-Hasan, with Fatimah walking behind him, and Ali behind her, and he said to them: When I pray, say &quot;Amen.&quot;
The bishop of Najran said: O Christians: I see so birght and lighted faces that, if they asked God to move a mountain from its place, He would do so. So do not invoke curses and be destroyed, leaving no Christian on the face of the earth until the Day of Judgment. Then they accepted the tribute and left. The Messenger of God - peace be upon him - said: &quot;By the One in whose hand is my soul, the punishment had descended upon the people of Najran, and if they had invoked curses, they would have been transformed into apes and pigs, and the valley would have been set ablaze against them, and God would have eradicated Najran and its people, even the birds on the trees, and the year would not have passed over the Christians until they perished&quot;.

(Tafsir Tabari)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Sahih al-Bukhari, Hudhayfah said: The Aqib and Sayyid, the leaders of Najran, came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, wanting to invoke a curse upon each other. One of them said to his companion: &quot;Do not do it, for by Allah, if he is a prophet and we invoke a curse, we will not succeed, neither us nor our descendants after us.&quot; The Prophet, peace be upon him, went out with Hasan, Husayn, and Fatimah as Allah commanded: &quot;Then say, &#39;Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves.&#39;&quot; [Al Imran: 61] But they were unable to challenge him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Christians were actually afraid to do that and by just seeing their faces they decided to run away.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/8533391196757362146/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/8533391196757362146?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/8533391196757362146'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/8533391196757362146'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/11/surah-al-imran-59-verse.html' title='Surah Al-Imran: 59, the verse'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-2982074257007732997</id><published>2024-11-16T03:52:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2024-11-16T03:52:28.289-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Holy Quran and Modern Science:</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;Cosmology and the Origin of the Universe:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were a closed-up mass, then We opened them out?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This verse literally proved the big-bang theory and proved that what was written 1400 years ago to be correct and modern science confirms it, Aswell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Origin of Life and Water:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Science says that everything was created from water and cannot live without water, so this is what Allah (SWT) says in the Holy Quran:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;And We made from water every living thing.

It reflects the scientific knowledge and worldviews that were available to the people of that era. In many instances, its descriptions of natural phenomena contradict what we now know through modern science.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The Quran is a book which has remained free of any contradiction, particularly in relation to scientific facts, whereas the Bible contains errors which were attributed to the knowledge of the time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-The Bible, The Quran and Science (1976)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr. Keith L.

Allah appoints an angel to deliver it to my grave just as gifts are delivered to one of you. My knowledge after my death is like my knowledge during my life.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Al-Daylami from Hakama from her father Uthman bin Dinar from his brother Malik bin Dinar from Anas).&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also narrated by: Al-Bayhaqi in Shu&#39;ab al-Iman (3/111, No. 3035).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a Sahih Hadith and the best one about the Prophet (S) still having the same knowledge which Allah (SWT) granted him during his blessed life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Imam Ibn Al Qayyim (rh) said:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The second characteristic: It is recommended to frequently send blessings upon the Prophet - peace be upon him - on this day and its night, for he said: &quot;Increase your prayers upon me on Friday and the night of Friday&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Messenger of Allah - peace be upon him - is the master of mankind, and Friday is the master of days. Therefore, sending prayers upon him on this day has a special merit not found on other days. Another wisdom is that every good his nation received in this world and the hereafter was through him, as Allah combined for his nation the good of this world and the hereafter through him. The greatest honor they receive will occur on Friday, as it is the day they are sent to their homes and palaces in paradise, and it is the day of increase for them when they enter paradise. It is a holiday for them in this world, and a day when Allah Almighty fulfills their requests and needs, and does not turn away their supplications. All of this was known and achieved because of him and through him. Therefore, out of gratitude, praise, and fulfilling a small part of his due right of him- ﷺ - it is encouraged to frequently send prayers upon him on this day and its night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Zaad Al Maa&#39;d 1/461)&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/316157512769247321/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/316157512769247321?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/316157512769247321'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/316157512769247321'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/11/ahadith-on-virtues-of-sending-salawat.html' title='Ahadith on the Virtues of Sending Salawat upon the Prophet (S) on Friday.

And not a single scientific report ever recorded an earthquake there after that, and not even a narration is recorded of a single earthquake that came after that event and they stopped after that.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/2012532149631554399/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/2012532149631554399?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/2012532149631554399'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/2012532149631554399'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/virtues-of-sayyiduna-umar-bin-khattab-ra.html' title='Virtues of Sayyiduna Umar Bin Khattab (RA)'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-4084231053301810778</id><published>2024-10-29T06:50:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-29T06:50:16.414-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The legend of Mount Qaf (قاف) From the sources:</title><content type='html'>Abu Salih narrated from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them. And Ikrimah also narrated from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them, saying God created a mountain called Qaf that surrounds the lower world, and its roots are connected to the rock on which the earth stands, and it is the rock mentioned by Luqman, peace be upon him, when he said: &quot;O my son, if it is the weight of a mustard seed and it is in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth&quot; [the verse]. So when God Almighty wants to shake a village on earth, He orders that mountain to move the root that is next to that village, and it shakes at that moment. Mujahid said: It is a mountain that surrounds the earth and the seas. It is narrated from Al-Dahhak that it is an emerald that is green.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(From the works of Ibn Abi Hatim, Imam Ismael, Ibn Kathir tafsir, Ibn Hajar Al Haythami&#39; fatwas 248 and the famous Ibn Abi Ad Dunya narrated it aswell in kitab Al qubat pg, 32).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And a group of scholars believe that the word Qaf in Surah Qaf means this mountain&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Ibn Kathir said:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;A group of the Salaf used to say that it is about a mountain called Qaf that surrounds the seven earths. (And Ibn Abbas (RA) belongs to this group)&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He added further:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;It is narrated by many, but this is a story about which God knows best, because we cannot reject it either&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the famous story of Dhul Qurnain visiting this mountain (Jabl Qaf) is authentic and it has been narrated with many isnads and there is reality in this story as there is also a saying of Ibn Abbas (RA) where he said that Dhul Qurnain made Alexandria out of white marble that is why they used to wear black there and later the monks there also wore black as it was started by Dhul Qurnain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And one thing that they say is that Dhul Qurnain came to this mountain to find the water of everlasting life, but this is not true because this is not proved, we are allowed to narrate from the People of the Book as God has allowed us in the Glorious Quran so that we can narrate from them, but one thing is that there are things in them that sound different or strange to our stories, then we reject them and otherwise we accept them blindly, and the story of St George (Jerjis) is also accepted by Muslims as Muslims. Otherwise we don&#39;t reject them or accept them blindly, we remain neutral towards them and the story of St. George (Jerjis) is also accepted by the Muslims because the Muslims narrated it more than the Christians and gave more details about this story which even the Christians did not have.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And there is another story it is very long also used by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Abi Al Dunya let me tell you guys that one in short:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Jibrael landed on Mount Qaf, and he saw rivers of different colours, blue, green, etc., and he saw creatures that were different, and he had never seen anything like this before, and he said: O my Lord, what is all this? I thought that I was the most special creature that You had created.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Allah (SWT) said to him, &quot;O Jibreel! you thought that you were the only good creation of your Lord, and this is nothing, and you have not yet seen the true power of your Lord, for this is only a small glimpse of His power and His glory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the Jibreel prostrated himself and said, &quot;O my Lord, glory be to thee, there is none like thee, and thy power is above all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And in another narration it is mentioned that the creatures who are in Mount Qaf do not know who is Adam and who is Shaitan and what is evil, and they are away from these things without any knowledge.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And even some scholars say that when the Day of Judgment comes, this earth will be finished, and some believe that the creatures that are on that mountain, the scholars say that it may be replaced with it after the Day of Judgment, And only Allah knows better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ibn Hajar al Haythami (rh) said:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;The philosophers have made the belief and rejected the text in which its clearly mentioned that how earth quakes are caused by the angel who moves the vein of Mount Qaf and it causes an earthquake and the philosophers say that it is only because the inside of the ground gets hot so its caused but its against the text&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Fatwas of Ibn Hajar pg, 248)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the traditional scholars were of the opinion that the existence of Mount Qaf cannot be denied and the narration of Ibn Abbas is not only from one book it has been narrated with different chains and even Ikrimah (RA) narrated what Ibn Abbas (RA) said in one narration and the great Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Al Dunya and many other scholars also narrated this narration. And in the journal of the University of Medina they also wrote that they accept the narration of Ibn Abbas (RA) as authentic because a chain is very good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And they said that the earthquake is only caused by the heating of the inside of the earth and this is the only reason and all the scholars of the university agree on this but this is what the philosophers said as Ibn Hajar wrote in his fatwa and they reject the text even when it is not contradicted by the strong text so we have to accept it instead of rejecting it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And One thing which was also in the journal of the Uni of Medina the writer of the Journal wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;That the narration of Ibn Abbas with the Isnad of Ibn Abi Hatim is good but Ibn Abbas (RA) must have taken it from the Israelies and from the jews as this is not Islamic and he took it from them for sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think it&#39;s fair to say that&#39;s a pretty far-fetched claim. It&#39;s also quite vague. This accusation that the Companion of the Prophet (S) is accused of taking stories from the Jews is quite far-fetched. And the scholar who wrote this about him should fear Allah (SWT).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And there is a narration which is often mentioned in many tafsirs that a Companion asked the Prophet (S) about this mount so he replied:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;He informed him that it is Mount &quot;Qaf,&quot; and that its height is a journey of five hundred years, and its length is a journey of two thousand years, and that it is made of green emerald.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the word &quot;tohu&quot; which is in the herbew if we arabize that word then it turns into &quot;Qaf&quot; so this word after getting arabized becomes Qaf.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And even in the Jewish Scripture this is mentioned with the word Tohu in the herbew language.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(i took the herbew words from this book on judaism called &#39;Hachikah&#39;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And this mountain is also quite famous in arab culture as you can read so many story books and they have made stories about this mountain and in the one thousand one nights or the arabian nights in that you can find stories about these mountains which are that some jinn kidnap some princess (ngl those stories made us imagine the jinn like some desperate creatures and horny but its not like that and those stories are fake aswell)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And What i have mentioned in this essay is from what the Scholars have said regarding this and what has been the belief of the Scholars of the Ahlus Sunnah regarding this Mountain (قاف).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And now to prove the earthquake narration being real is also proved from science:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr. David Rothery, a volcanologist at The Open University, &quot;The movement of tectonic plates is the fundamental driver of both earthquakes and volcanic activity. Where tectonic plates meet, stress builds up and is released through earthquakes, while the same processes can lead to the formation and eruption of volcanoes. And the Movement inside the Ground causes earth to shake resulting in what you call an Earth-Quake&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it is also proved from the Quote of this Professor that something shakes inside the Ground and because of that other plates also shake and the Eath moves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the question now is, who makes the earth move?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As it was mentioned in the narrations above that Allah (SWT) orders His angel to shake the vein from Mount Qaf, and we can believe this because science also confirms that something moves it, and we all know that there is something that does everything, the One who made the Big Bang possible, the One who keeps the sky from falling.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And we know that it is Allah (SWT), so from the above narrations it is proven that Allah orders His angel to shake the vein that comes from Mount Qaf, and then the shaking that occurs makes a certain place shake because it results in an earthquake.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thus Those narrations are proved from Science aswell.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/4084231053301810778/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/4084231053301810778?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/4084231053301810778'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/4084231053301810778'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-legend-of-mount-qaf-from-sources.html' title='The legend of Mount Qaf (قاف) From the sources:'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-7228936246000871969</id><published>2024-10-25T12:22:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-25T12:22:24.965-07:00</updated><title type='text'>How to pray Salah?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 5 Fard(required)prayers sinful to miss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fajr - 2 rakats(units)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dhuhr - 4 rakats&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asr - 4 rakats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maghrib- 3 rakats&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isha- 4 rakats&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.Starting Salah (Intention and Takbir)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Begin by forming an intention in your heart to pray a specific prayer (e.g., Dhuhr, Asr). While the intention is usually kept in the heart, some may choose to say it verbally. Start with Takbir (&quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;), raising hands to either the shoulders or the ears.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Placing the Hands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After Takbir, you can place your hands either:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Below the navel , above the navel but below the chest.Or, leave them at your sides.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Reciting Surah Al-Fatihah&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Recite Surah Al-Fatihah yourself for silent prayers and audibly for prayers like Fajr, Maghrib, and Isha. This is Sunnah but not required but highly recommended.&amp;nbsp; Reciting Surah Al-Fatihah, you may either:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Recite &quot;&lt;i&gt;Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim&lt;/i&gt;&quot; quietly or aloud or skip the Basmala altogether in silent prayers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;After finishing Al-Fatihah, recite another surah or verses from the Quran if you wish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Going into Ruku’ (Bowing)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Allahu Akbar&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and bow, placing your hands on your knees. For Ruku’, you may:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Raise your hands to the shoulders or ears before bowing.Or, keep hands down without raising them again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Standing Back Up (I’tidal)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When rising from Ruku&#39;, you may:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Raise hands to the shoulders or ears and say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (&quot;Allah hears those who praise Him&quot;).Or, do not raise the hands again and simply say the phrase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once fully standing, you can say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Rabbana wa lakal-hamd&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (&quot;Our Lord and to You is all praise&quot;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sujood (Prostration)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Allahu Akbar&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and go into sujood - 2 per rakat , placing your hands and knees on the ground. When moving into sujood:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some prefer to go down on hands first, then knees.Others place knees first, then hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In sujood, make sure that the forehead, nose, palms, knees, and toes touch the ground.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Tashahhud (Sitting Position and Finger Position)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During Tashahhud - second rakat and fourth rakat , third rakat in Maghrib, keep your right index finger pointed in different ways:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Raise it briefly when saying &quot;&lt;i&gt;Ashhadu alla ilaha illa Allah&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and then put it down.Or keep it pointed and moving slightly throughout the Tashahhud. Or raise it and keep it steady without movement.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Complete the Tashahhud, and add the final supplications (Durood and Dua).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ending Salah (Tasleem)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To conclude Salah, turn your head to the right and say &quot;&lt;i&gt;Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; then to the left saying the same.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/7228936246000871969/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/7228936246000871969?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/7228936246000871969'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/7228936246000871969'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/how-to-pray-salah.html' title='How to pray Salah?'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-1515775768209298424</id><published>2024-10-24T06:52:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-24T06:52:04.292-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Abu Jahl the loser</title><content type='html'>Once the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) prostrated, Abu Jahl (LA) picked up a stone and approached him. But when he got close, he turned back, terrified and pale, his hands dried on the stone until he dropped it. The men of Quraysh came to him and said: &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, O Abu al-Hakam?&quot;

He said: I went up to him to do what I told you yesterday, but as I approached him, a male camel appeared in front of me. By God, I have never seen a head like his, nor a neck or tusks like his for any male camel. He was about to devour me.

Abu Jahl&#39;s heroism was imaginary, and his boasting of threats was sophistical. It wasn&#39;t just once that he retreated, but many times, as narrated by the author of &quot;Al-Halabiya&quot; and Ibn Kathir in the biography, including:

Al-Araashi, a man from the tribe of Khath&#39;am, sold camels to Abu Jahl, who then delayed payment. The Quraysh directed him to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, knowing Abu Jahl&#39;s intense enmity towards the message and its bearer, peace and blessings be upon him. When Al-Araashi explained his situation to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he went with him to ensure he received his due from Abu Jahl. When he knocked on Abu Jahl&#39;s door, Abu Jahl came out with a pale face, as if he were dust-colored, which is a yellowish hue with dullness. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, &quot;Give this man his right.&quot; Abu Jahl replied, &quot;Yes, do not leave until I give him what is his.&quot; And he handed it over to him.

Abu Jahl (LA) whenever he intended to hurt or insult Rasul Allah ﷺ Allah (SWT) always helped his Prophet ﷺ and made Abu Jahl afraid so much that he would start trembling. The one who used to make bold claims infront of the kuffar and the muhsriks would start sweating after seeing Rasul Allah ﷺ.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/1515775768209298424/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/1515775768209298424?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/1515775768209298424'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/1515775768209298424'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/abu-jahl-loser.html' title='Abu Jahl the loser'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-3322879603227287424</id><published>2024-10-19T12:32:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2024-12-19T15:36:13.924-08:00</updated><title type='text'>“al-Mawāhib al-Ladinnīyyaħ”, ʾImām ʾIbrāhīm al-Bājūrī ash-Shāfiʿī does Tawassul through the rank of the Prophet ﷺ for his closing Duʿāʾ.</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&quot;And this compilation, may God have mercy on him, was concluded by highlighting two significant points: an encouragement to perfect the science of Hadith, increasing in it, and exerting effort in acquiring it.

(Daniel (8:21)

”And the fourth kingdom will be solid as iron, for iron crushes and crushes all things.”
”And as iron breaks, it shatters and breaks in pieces all these” (this is about the Roman Empire)
(Daniel (2:40)

Nebuchadnezzar saw a stone cut out of a great mountain without a cutter, and it struck that statue on its feet, which were of iron and clay. And the blow was so strong that the whole statue was shattered, with its gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay, and became fragments and rubble, blown away by the wind, so that no trace of it was seen. But the stone that broke the statue became a great, high mountain, and the whole earth was filled with it.

This is a prophecy of the emergence of Islam. Islam clashed at the beginning of the call with the Roman Empire and then with the Persian Empire. At that time, the Roman Empire had extended its authority over the Greek king of Alexandria and reached the peak of strength. The Persian Empire had extended its authority over Babylon, then the power of Islam struck them, and at that time iron, pottery, copper and silver were crushed together and became like chaff from the threshing floor in the summer.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thus, the arrangement of events and their interpretation in &lt;b&gt;Daniel’s&lt;/b&gt; vision foretells news whose meaning is beyond doubt... since we know that Babylon was succeeded by Persia and Media and that the power of Persia and Media was broken by the power of Alexander, and that the kingdom of Alexander was succeeded by the Roman Empire, which established from its capital Constantinople the pillars of a European-Asian kingdom. Then this kingdom was defeated and the Islamic conquest and the raids of the &lt;b&gt;Prophet ﷺ &lt;/b&gt;and the Companions brought it down .”

And then we had the Ottoman Empire, which completely wiped out the Roman Empire and brought Islam to all possible places and became a great cause in spreading Islam in the Balkans.

And as for the Christians claiming that they still rule those places now, that does not mean that they are correct, because there is no Christian rule there, but completely secular, and this prophecy was about a force that would cover all the lands, and it was fulfilled as the Muslims literally conquered all the places they had and ruled them and crushed them, just as it was written in the prophecy of &lt;b&gt;Daniel AS&lt;/b&gt;.

And when Imam Mahdi will come, no land will remain in the rule of Christians or anyone else, he will end all the enemies of Islam and he will have his army which is famously known as the Black Flag Army and his army with him will conquer all the places and this time they will not allow anyone to remain as a polytheist, they will have no choice but to convert to Islam or fight and when they will fight, all of them will be ended and in some time&lt;b&gt; Jesus AS&lt;/b&gt; will come back and This time they will not allow anyone to remain a polytheist and they will have no choice but to convert to Islam or to fight and when they will fight all of them will be finished and in some time &lt;b&gt;Jesus AS&lt;/b&gt; will come back again and all the Christians will convert to Islam and thus once again the Muslims will get back their great army and will rule over the whole world.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/5115817677387807727/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/5115817677387807727?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/5115817677387807727'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/5115817677387807727'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-prophecy-of-prophet-daniel-as.html' title='The Prophecy of Prophet Daniel (AS) explanation from the Bible of the ending of the 4 kingdoms and a Solid state replacing them'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-6005512150086982571</id><published>2024-10-17T14:28:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-17T14:29:02.130-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Imam An Nawawi (rh) on Muslim 2674 Hadith in the Sharh Sahih Muslim (vol:16/228)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&quot;This Hadith [2674] Whoever calls to guidance and whoever calls to misguidance, these two hadiths are clear in urging the desirability of establishing good things and the prohibition of establishing bad things, and that whoever establishes a good Sunnah will have a reward like that of everyone who acts upon it, until On the Day of Resurrection, whoever establishes a bad practice will bear the burden of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection. And whoever calls to guidance will have the rewards of those who follow him, or to misguidance will bear the sins of those who follow him, whether that guidance or misguidance was initiated by him or he was preceded to it, and whether that was teaching. Knowledge, worship, etiquette, or other than that. His statement, may God bless him and grant him peace, “and he acted upon it after him” means that if he established it, whether the action was during his life or after his death, and God knows best.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And What is mentioned as Good here is what is Good in Islam and a good deed if anyone introduces a way for good then it is not considered bad if its good for anyone and is benefical for the People.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And we can also use the Hadith without going into its explanation and can use it to prove that establishing good means that whoever establishes a good act will have reward for introducing it and regarding Mawlid its a very good practise which is proved from the text is a very benefical one for the believer so those who introduced it and celebrated it in the proper way will have its reward if others follow them correctly.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/6005512150086982571/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/6005512150086982571?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/6005512150086982571'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/6005512150086982571'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/imam-nawawi-rh-on-muslim-2674-hadith-in.html' title='Imam An Nawawi (rh) on Muslim 2674 Hadith in the Sharh Sahih Muslim (vol:16/228)'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-5201392574419412008</id><published>2024-10-15T11:30:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2024-12-19T15:36:55.293-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Mulla Ali Qari’a commentary of the Shifa</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;The text in English is translated as followed:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;... and it is not the place to mention all of them (&#39;and in the narration is a long story&#39;), meaning in the actions of the day and night for Ibn Al-Sunni, may Allah be pleased with him. Abdullah Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, lost movement and weakness overcame his limbs, as though they were the limbs of a man overcome by laziness and incapacity, deprived of movement. It was said to him, &#39;Shall I remind you of the name of the most beloved to you, and will this affliction be removed from you?&#39; He (Ibn Umar) responded with &#39;Yes.&#39; So he called with the loudest of his voice, &#39;Ya Muhammadah!&#39; (O Muhammad!). Immediately, his limbs were restored, and it was as though nothing had afflicted him.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is in volume 2, page 43 in the Sharh of Al Shifa.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Story being mentioned here is :&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He said, ‘If the person who said this had realised Islam, he would have become a Muslim.’ The meaning is that you will meet what is destined for you, which is Allah, the Almighty, and she wants to know, because death sometimes takes the honourable and sometimes annihilates the unkind, and the meaning is that I wish I knew about it. (and my beloved) with the opening of the Ya, not as Al-Antaqi said necessary (al-Dar), meaning whether they will prevent me from visiting him (meaning) the woman by saying my beloved (the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace) and by saying al-Dar (Paradise, the place of decision) (so ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) sat crying) i.e. for longing or for separation or parting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is narrated (in the Day and Night Work of Ibn al-Sunni) that ‘Abdullah ibn ’Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) had a numbness in his leg, meaning that it was unable to move and was weakened by the gathering of its nerves due to laziness and lethargy, like a sleepy man, and it did not go away (it was said to him He cried out at the top of his voice, ‘O Muhammadah!’ with a silent eh, as if he wanted to show his love as part of an appeal for help (and his leg immediately spread out), as if he wanted to show his love as well within the context of seeking help (Istighatha).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Imam Mulla Ali Qari (rh) used the word Istighatha in his work as what Ibn Umar (RA) said was clearly Ya Muhammadah which is understood in Arabic language in the sense of asking someone for help and the Companions said this during the battle of Yamamah against Musalma the liar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ibn Al Sunni (rh) , from Mujahid who said A man&#39;s leg became numb in the presence of Ibn &#39;Abbas, and Ibn &#39;Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: &quot;Name the person you love the most: Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Those 4 ayats are : &lt;b&gt;Surah Baqarah 2:143 , Surah An Nisa 4:41 , Surah Ahzab 33:45-46 , Surah Al Fath 48:8 , Surah Nahl 16:84/16:89.&lt;/b&gt; The other ayat about being a witness (&lt;b&gt;Surah Al Maida 5:117&lt;/b&gt;) is about the Prophet Isa(Jesus) AS implying that other Prophets and Messengers will be witness for their people.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, &lt;b&gt;Surah Al Isra 17:71&lt;/b&gt; states that people will be summoned with &quot;their leader&quot;. This could be mean deeds , Prophet or scripture.  As per footnote in the ayat. The &lt;b&gt;tafsir of Ibn Kathir &lt;/b&gt;says that the meaning could also mean &lt;b&gt;&quot;Imam , Mujahid&quot;.&lt;/b&gt; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Qatadah said that it meant each nation would be called to account by its Prophet.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Ibn Zayd said it means they would be called to account by their Book which was revealed to their Prophet with its laws.&lt;/b&gt; &quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This links with this hadith:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;“&lt;b&gt;My life is good for you, and my death is good for you, your deeds are shown to me, whatever is good I thank Allah for it, and whatever is evil I seek forgiveness from Allah.&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;b&gt;[Imam Bazzar, Musnad Bazzar]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This shows that the&lt;b&gt; Prophet ﷺ&lt;/b&gt; sees our deeds. When ever we do a good deed he thanks Allah and when we sin he seeks forgiveness for us from Allah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similarly,&amp;nbsp; we have an angel who writes our good deeds and one who writes our bad deeds. They will be our witness as well. As well as this, if someone was to reject his sins on the day of judgement then those body parts whom we did the sin will be a witness against him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a book written by Imam Suyuti called &lt;b&gt;Sharh as-Sudur.&lt;/b&gt; In a chapter, a hadith is found where the&lt;b&gt; Prophet ﷺ&lt;/b&gt; says people who have died were are related to you if they find out you&#39;ve done good they&#39;ll do dua for you asking for your guidance like they have been guidance.

&lt;b&gt;Good, Bad (haram), Disliked (Makruh), Recommended (Mustahabb), Neutral (Mubāh).&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Every act proven from the text is a good innovation, as Imam Shafi (rh) said that Bidah is of two types: good, which comes from the Companions, and bad, which contradicts the text.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sayyiduna Umar (RA) said on two different occasions that this innovation is good and in another narration &quot;&lt;b&gt;Blessing of Bidah&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Both recorded in &lt;b&gt;Sahih Al Bukhari&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the scholars of the Sunnah agree on the types of innovation&quot;. (Tahawi&#39;s quote ends here, it is too long as he quotes too many scholars to prove this).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Even Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (rh) said:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Innovation is of types&lt;/b&gt;.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So this is proof that the scholars of the Ahlus Sunna throughout history have said that there are types of innovation and there was no disagreement among them, but only a small group that became Ahlul Hadith and ignored the explanations of the Hadith went wrong on issues and committed errors without fixing them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And if all the scholars of the past were wrong, as some say, then their books shouldn&#39;t be studied, but without them we cannot have any Islamic scholarship, and those great scholars are so important that without their works and opinions we cannot understand or go deep into Islam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And They say that the Hadith regarding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Every Innovation is Misguidance&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scholars have explained it that innovation that is in religion and worship that cannot be proved from the text or from the Companions and acts that are added to religion and are not from the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ so this is the definition of this hadith that we must avoid this type of innovation and those who do this type of innovation are called innovators.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the Saying of Muadh Ibn Jabal (RA) :&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Whatever the Muslims (majority of them) see as Good is Good.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This saying of the Companion is explained in &lt;b&gt;Sharh Miskhat Al Masibh&lt;/b&gt; by Mulla Ali Qari (rh):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;The saying of seeing as good means what was the consensus of the Muslims on a subject, as the majority that had a consensus on something from the early times will be right.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(&lt;b&gt;Sharh of Hadith number 1345&lt;/b&gt; in the edition which I use)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shaykh Ibn Tayimiyyah (rh) in &lt;b&gt;Majmu fatawi (20/163)&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;The misguidance of those who innovate a path or a belief, claiming that the faith is not complete without it, while knowing that the Messenger did not mention it, is known. Whatever contradicts the texts is an innovation according to the consensus of Muslims. Whatever is not known to contradict them cannot be called an innovation. Al-Shafi&#39;i - may Allah have mercy on him - said: There are two types of innovation: an innovation that contradicts the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus. And according to some of the companions of the Messenger of God, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, this is an innovation of misguidance. And an innovation that does not contradict any of this, then it is good, because of the saying of Umar: What a good innovation this is, these words or something like them. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it with his authentic chain of transmission in Al-Madkhal.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This information should be more than enough to explain the concept of what innovation (Bid&#39;ah) is in Islam and the view of traditional scholars is always correct as the majority agree and there is a consensus on this issue by the majority that its correct.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/feeds/5620689320342137006/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/249727478542539485/5620689320342137006?isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/5620689320342137006'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/249727478542539485/posts/default/5620689320342137006'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com/2024/10/good-innovation-and-bad-innovation-from.html' title='Good Innovation and Bad Innovation from the views of Traditional and the Greatest Scholars of Islam and Evidence from the Text:'/><author><name>anonymous </name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15261569427996281384</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
